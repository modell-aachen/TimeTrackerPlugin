---++ Usage

You can use the TimeTrackerPlugin to record activities.

Each activity can have an attached ticket and project, can be commented and stores the time spent on this activity in time spans, which are set upon the play / pause button.

An activity can be manually marked as booked or unbooken and can be booked in Redmine once.

An unbooked activity can be edited, including the time spans and a general time correction for this activity.
