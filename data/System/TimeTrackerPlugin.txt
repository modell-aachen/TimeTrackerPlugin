---++ Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
